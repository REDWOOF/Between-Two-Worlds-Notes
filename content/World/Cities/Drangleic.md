A huge city full of magic. The people who know of its location seem to keep it a secret, even the mother of [[Norovar]]. It appears that some artifacts lead to it, like the [[Drangleic Coin]] that [[Norovar]] has when paired with the [[Eye of Norovar]].

A [[Massive Dragon Corpse]] is pierced by a spear in the center of it, it looks like a statue, but it might just be a preserved corpse.
