### Instructions:

“Keep the egg very warm, intense heat wouldn’t even harm the shell and might even boost its hatching speed. It’s very important we don’t let the egg go cold.

When hatched, wyrmlings are pretty random, one thing they have in general are constant sleepiness and a big appetite for meat and… cabbage?

“Discard wyrmling if it bears the birthmark”. Next to it was a drawing of the birthmark, which is very similar to the mark Norovar can see under my eye. Caladrius doesn't seem to have it.

“Feed mushrooms” along with it a drawing of a mushroom which seems like it would grow in the cold. ==Most likely in Icewind Dale==

==To tame, speak those words:== “Grow thine beast, With the power of Calamity, thy will grow strong.”
