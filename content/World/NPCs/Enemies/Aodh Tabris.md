##### [[Rêvgo Druci (Solas Tabris)]]'s revived brother.
***

He is the perfect soul for [[Calamity]]. He struck a deal with [[Wrath]].

Refer to the [[Book of Aodh]] for further info. It seems that Galahad killing Aodh will just continue the cycle of rebirth. ==He plans to end the world using Calamity==, maybe with the help of the [[Cultists of Calamity]]?

Apparently, Aodh reincarnates every 1 000 years?

We found him chained to a chair in the masquerade, it seems the lack of magic prevents him from healing.
