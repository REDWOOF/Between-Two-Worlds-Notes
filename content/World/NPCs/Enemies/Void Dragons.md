### Extract from the Dragonology book:

In the annals of dragon lore, none loom larger or more ominous than the Void Dragon. Legend tells of its birth as cataclysmic as it is mysterious: from a colossal egg, whose mere hatching shatters the moon. The Void Dragon emerges with four heads, each a harbinger of cosmic chaos and unparalleled power.

Few have witnessed the birth of a Void Dragon and lived to tell the tale. Those who have are said to have glimpsed the very fabric of reality unraveling before their eyes. It is said that the only opportunity to slay a Void Dragon lies in its infancy, before it can ascend to its full potential. Yet, such an endeavor is fraught with peril, for the might of a newly hatched Void Dragon is still unmatched by mortal hands.

As enigmatic as their birth is their existence. Void Dragons are rare, appearing only once every millennium, if not longer. Whether they are drawn by some cosmic cycle or simply the whim of fate remains unknown. What becomes of a Void Dragon as it grows, few can say, for those who encounter them rarely live to tell the tale.

Among the scant records that exist, one name stands out: Galahad. A lone figure in history, said to have slain a Void Dragon and emerged with an unknown power. Some whisper that this power is the key to understanding the secrets of the cosmos, while others fear its potential to unravel existence itself.

Thus, the legend of the Void Dragon endures, a testament to the unfathomable depths of the universe and the courage of those who dare to challenge its mysteries.
