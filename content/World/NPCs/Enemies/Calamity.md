##### The curse affecting [[Rêvgo Druci (Solas Tabris)]].
---

The curse is worshipped by [[Cultists of Calamity]].

It seems to transform Rêvgo further into a dragon, into Calamity. Its goal is to ==kill all druids and dragonborns.== It's an ancient curse ==given from an ancient dragon 10 000 to 20 000 years ago.== There are a couple million souls in Calamity.

Rêvgo's tail seems to resist to [[Wrath]]. Maybe the two have a weird connection. 

### How it affected Rêvgo's body:

- Tail growth / Appearance
- Wings growth / appearance
- Height growth
- Breath Weapon more powerful

### How to check current percentage: #MissingInfo 

Rêvgo may spend all his spell slots to channel it into information on Calamity: the percentage until the golden spot where he will be at the most control and the most powerful.

**Currently at 2.8%**


### How to survive Calamity:

Either ==find a way to transfer my soul to another body==. However, the soul seems to be the powerhouse of Calamity, ==this might not work then.==
OR
Greed talks/fights Wrath to convince him to save me from Calamity.

### How to defeat Calamity:
- Destroy Aodh
- Absorb his half of the Curse
- Fight Calamity in its domain, the [[Garden of Resurgence]].
