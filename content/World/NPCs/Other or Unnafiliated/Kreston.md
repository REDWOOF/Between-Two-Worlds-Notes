Kreston gave us jobs. These include:
- Cleaning Conyberry of bandits and monsters
- Assassinating four targets at the annual masquerade of Neverwinter.

For the second job, the assassination, he owes us 5,000 GP each.

We should also ask him why Isobel was part of the victims as she genuinelly seems like a normal person.
