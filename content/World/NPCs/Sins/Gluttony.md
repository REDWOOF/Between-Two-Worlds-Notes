#NPC #Sin #Eldrin

#### Appearance:
A yellow parasite; it has many user like the group of [[Gluttony Users]].

#### History:
A black form with a yellow head reaches out to his face with his hands, grabs a yellow orb and starts eating.

A frailer version of the person walks in a desert with red sand. He walks up to [Halleck](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FEnnemies%2FHalleck) and tackles it then attempts to bite it.

Halleck grows, tendrils pushes and writhe out of his back. It fights Gluttony who's still devouring him alive. Despite tearing Gluttony to shreds, he survives.

He walks away, stronger than before, to join 3 black beings (3 sins) discussing at a table about something.
