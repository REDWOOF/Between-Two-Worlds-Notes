An armor made of Nefra, a necklace on the torso allows the user to hide or reveal the armor.

- **Gauntlets:** Creates a goo clone of the user at the cost of their energy. The clone is unable to speak and cannot cast spells.

A user of Lust can become a cannibal after a while.

### History:

The armor was forged at the Nefraforge.
Its true form is one of the first vampires, she owned a castle and ate every single person they could, reducing the population by 20%.
The [[Castle of Lust]] still remains with bits of Lust. She is dead with power still remaining, she can be revived by certain people, although they have no interest in doing so.
