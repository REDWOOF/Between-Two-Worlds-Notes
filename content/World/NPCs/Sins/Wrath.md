#NPC #Sin #Rêvgo 

The sin of undying anger. It revived The Black Spider.

It allows the user to use minor telekinesis and project nefra from their body as tools, weapons...

==To kill Wrath==, one must bring it to 100% of its power, killing it and absorb the opposite virtue. (In this case, [[Patience]]).

He broke the orbs of memories in the temple. He struck a pact with a dragon and had disagreements with the other [sins.](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FSins%2F7%20Sins)

#### History:
Wrath got into a  disagreement with the other black figures, he had a huge sword and was unhappy.
He spoke to a dragon, made a pact with it and killed a lot of dragonborns. (*This means he uses Rêvgo just for his link with Calamity.*)
Wrath broke the last orb as I was about to touch it. He’s either ashamed or is simply trying to hide something from me.
