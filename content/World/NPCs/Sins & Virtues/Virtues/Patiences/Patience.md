The opposite of [[Wrath]]. It is separated into 3 times: [[Past]], [[Present]], [[Future]]

### Using Legend Lore:

[[Lancelot]], harbinger of patience, wields time's sway, halting, skipping, or stalling at whim. Through eons halted, wisdom amassed, tomes devoured in temporal hush. None dare challenge, for he holds knowledge vast, surpassing virtues and vices alike. His sorcery reigns supreme, a match for ancient gods. Master of the arcane, vanquisher of greed's mightiest, even in the shadow of lust's armor ([[Rollam (Dead)]]).
