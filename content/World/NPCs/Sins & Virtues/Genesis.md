Origin of [[Despair]] and [[Hope]].

We found an image in Gnomengard that seems to reference the sins.

We can see 2 sides of 7 characters, the Sins and Virtues.
The brightest start is a big angel (Genesis), surrounded by Hope and Despair.
The two other prominent stars and the 5 petalled flowers remain unknown.
