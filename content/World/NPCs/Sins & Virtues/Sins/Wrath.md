### Appearance:

A neatly packed set of tools made out of nefra. The bag containing it was labelled "DANGER DANGER DANGER" in Ancient Druidic.
It then melts and replaces the user's bone marrow.

### Abilities:

- It allows the user to use telekinesis on objects within a set size and weight limit, depending on the strength of the user. It cancels when a creature is touching the item.
- Allows the user to exchange their defence for more offense and vice versa.
- It is possible that it can revive its user, although it is likely Wrath only revives those who have destructive capabilities.
- It may also be used as different tools, like gem smoothing tools for exemple.


### History:
Wrath got into a  disagreement with the other black figures, he had a huge sword and was unhappy.
He spoke to a dragon, made a pact with it and killed a lot of dragonborns. (*This means he uses Rêvgo just for his link with Calamity.*)
Wrath broke the last orb as I was about to touch it. He’s either ashamed or is simply trying to hide something from me.

### Other:

He broke the orbs of memories in the temple of Olidammara.
