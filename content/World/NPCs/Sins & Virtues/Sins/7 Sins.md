##### Group of info concerning all sins.

Their items consist of [[Nefra]]. They seem to be held in the [[Planetree]]

All of the sin's history is "written" in the [[Temple of Olidammara]].

### Shared history:

A [gray form (Genesis)](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FGenesis) eats a fruit and splits into two: a white and black form ([Hope](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FVirtues%2FHope) and [Despair](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FSins%2FDespair)). They eat together and the black one storms out of the room. After a fight where Despair is victorious, they both eat a fruit and split into 7 (14 in total).

This means that Despair wanted everyone to be separate, but why?
