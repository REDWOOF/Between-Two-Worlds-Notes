### Appearance:

A yellow parasite; it has many user like the group of [[Gluttony Users]].

### Abilities:

Allows the user to extend their hand and close it to "eat" a portion of the world. Depending on the power of the user, this extends from small rocks to body parts and huge chunks of bridges.

### History:

A black form with a yellow head (Gluttony) reaches out to his face with his hands, grabs a yellow orb and starts eating.

A frailer version of the person walks in a desert with red sand. He walks up to [Halleck](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FEnemies%2FHalleck) and tackles it then attempts to bite it.

[Halleck](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FEnemies%2FHalleck) grows, tendrils pushes and writhe out of his back. It fights Gluttony who's still devouring him alive. Despite tearing Gluttony to shreds, he survives.

He walks away, stronger than before, to join 3 black beings (3 sins) discussing at a table about something.
