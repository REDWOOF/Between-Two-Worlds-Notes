##### In the hands of [[Rêvgo Druci (Solas Tabris)]]. The text fades in during time and it seems to be written by multiple people. It seems to work like a group chat. Rêvgo switched books when he met Laine.

[[Aodh Tabris]], the true world ender, the bringer of [[Calamity]]. The ==**[[garden of Resurgence]]**== is his birth and the end. The new gods will reign over as the old ones’ souls go into nothingness and obscurity. There are two souls within him.
The fourteen shall bring souls to the new gods as the 3 husks watch over.
The husks names are:
- [Despair](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FSins%2FDespair)
- [Hope](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FVirtues%2FHope)
- [Genesis](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FGenesis)

[[Aodh Tabris]], with the power of liberation, ==released the shackles that bound [[Wrath]]== within the confines of his cell. With a symphony of arcane, ==he conversed with [[Calamity]]==, striking an accord that shook fate. He ==freed a child of Temperance==, releasing a soul from the labyrinth of restraint into the expanse of possibility.

Yet, amidst these acts, [[Aodh Tabris]] became an alchemist of souls, a vessel for the amalgamation of essences. He drank from the chalice of experience, becoming one with the hues of countless spirits, each imprinting upon him their essence, their wisdom, their goals. Thus, he stands now, a tapestry woven from the fabric of diverse souls, a mosaic of resonance, a form of boundless potential.

[[Aodh Tabris]] has found the ==red transmutation circle.== The end is near. (*Apparently, this is VERY bad*)

Sometime in the last 6,000 years, the [[Day of Imbalance]] befell us, resulting in the overturning of Faerun and transmogrifying our existence into what it is today. 

It is well documented that the imbalance and rescindment of Faerun occurred in tandem, and it is of common belief that the [[Goddex]], previously considered a chuya, protector of life and virtue, caused or had a massive hand in the event.

[[Aetheon]] (*God?*) was responsible for the regeneration of [[Aodh Tabris]] and provided him with his sublime powers. It was once of common belief that [[Aodh Tabris]] had become forever eternal from his dispense, but in actuality, Aodh reincarnated every 1 000 years. ==His brain is preserved in all its purity, unlike the rest of his body.== (*Then what happens to Solas Tabris?*)

### Changed book with Laine

**Existentialist:**
The [[Sands of Time]] and [[Gaze of Death]], some call it fate, or even destiny, but to me, this is war. Everything has a cost.

The [[Day of Imbalance]] and the myth of [[Aetheon]]'s involvement are fabrications, spun to mislead and control. The truth of Faerun's transformation lies not in celestial tampering but in the inherent flux of existence, a natural cycle of creation and dissolution that has always governed our realm.

The notion that the [[Goddex]], once a protector of life, orchestrated such an upheaval is a convenient scapegoat to explain the incomprehensible. This narrative diverts attention from the true forces at play: the inevitable evolution of reality itself.

[[Aetheon]], credited with granting [[Aodh Tabris]] his powers and ensuring his reincarnation, is no divine benefactor. The regeneration of Aodh is an arcane process, rooted in the deepest mysteries of the world, independent of any supposed deity's intervention. The tales of his brain's preservation and the purity of his reincarnated forms are embellished legends, romanticizing a cycle of rebirth that is far more mundane.

[Solas Tabris](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=Party%2FR%C3%AAvgo%20Druci%20(Solas%20Tabris)), the ==supposed== successor, is not a figure of mystic continuation but a symbol of renewal, representing the natural progression of time and the persistence of legacy through more earthly means. The [[Sands of Time]] and the [[Gaze of Death]] are not mere fate or destiny, but the harsh reality of existence, a perpetual war where every action has its price, and every soul must reckon with the consequences of their choices.
(*It seems that people believe Rêvgo is a successor to Aodh, as in the "creature" that keeps getting revived.*)

Seek the truth beyond the myths, for in understanding the natural order, we must find the real power to shape our REAL fate.

**Mythicalist:**
To dismiss the tales of the [[Day of Imbalance]] and [[Aetheon]]'s role in the saga of Aodh as mere fabrications is to underestimate the vastness of our ignorance. We dwell in a world where the boundaries between reality and myth are often indistinguishable, and to deny the fantastical is to blind oneself to the potential truths hidden within them. 

Our understanding is but a fragment of the whole, a mere sliver of the grand tapestry of existence. The legends of Faerun’s transformation, the involvement of the [[Goddex]], and the arcane power bestowed upon [[Aodh Tabris]] by [[Aetheon]], all hold truth that our limited comprehension cannot yet fully grasp. These narratives, passed down through ages, are not merely stories but reflections of a deeper reality that transcends our current understanding.  (*It seems that they refer Calamity as an arcane power.*)

Embrace the possibility that these myths are more than just allegories. Accept that within these tales lies a wisdom that we are not yet equipped to fully decode. The regeneration of [[Aodh Tabris]], his preserved mind, and the ==enigmatic role of [Solas Tabris](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=Party%2FR%C3%AAvgo%20Druci%20(Solas%20Tabris)) point to truths beyond the mundane, truths that challenge our very perception of reality.== 
(*Rêvgo's birth is unusual, it seems that it's the first time the curse of Calamity targets a birth of twins. These scholars therefore do not know exactly why I exist, since fate is prewritten.*)

Fantasy and fact are not mutually exclusive but intertwined threads of the same fabric. By accepting the fantastical elements of our history, we open ourselves to a broader spectrum of knowledge and understanding. The [[Sands of Time]] and the [[Gaze of Death]] may seem like poetic notions, but they encapsulate the essence of our existence—an existence where every mystery solved reveals yet another layer of the unknown. 

Do not be quick to discard what you cannot yet fully explain. Embrace the fantastical, for in doing so, you honour the limitless potential of knowledge and the ever-expanding horizon of truth.

**Any:**
In the midst of our discussions on [[Aodh Tabris]] and the nature of myths, let us not forget the importance of unity. The strength of our knowledge lies in ==our collective wisdom.== Each perspective, whether sceptical or accepting of the fantastical, contributes to a broader understanding. (*This definitely works as a text chat, sort of like sending stones but text form. The scholars are divided into two groups; those who reject myths and legends and those who embrace it as history.*)

Amidst our ongoing discussions, I have uncovered new information that may shed light on our current understanding. 
Recent expeditions suggest that the [[Whispering Grove]] holds secrets about the cycles of rebirth and the nature of [[Aodh Tabris]]' reincarnations. The [[Mirror of Souls]] is also said to be active once more, though making more paintings would likely prove useless at this point.
Or perhaps we should continue onto the[[ Catacombs of Eldara]] per our original plan? That still may bear more fruit than the actual forest, funnily enough. (*Is the Catacombs of Eldara the place under that dragon shaped hill, or the sarcophagi opened by Eldrin?*)
