[[Aodh Tabris]], the true world ender, the bringer of Calamity. The ==**garden of Resurgence**== is his birth and the end. The new gods will reign over as the old ones’ souls go into nothingness and obscurity. There are two souls within him.
The fourteen shall bring souls to the new gods as the 3 husks watch over.
The husks names are:
- [Despair](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FSins%2FDespair)
- [Hope](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FVirtues%2FHope)
- [Genesis](obsidian://open?vault=Between%20Two%20Worlds&file=World%2FNPCs%2FGenesis)

[[Aodh Tabris]], with the power of liberation, ==released the shackles that bound Wrath== within the confines of his cell. With a symphony of arcane, ==he conversed with Calamity==, striking an accord that shook fate. He ==freed a child of Temperance==, releasing a soul from the labyrinth of restraint into the expanse of possibility.

Yet, amidst these acts, [[Aodh Tabris]] became an alchemist of souls, a vessel for the amalgamation of essences. He drank from the chalice of experience, becoming one with the hues of countless spirits, each imprinting upon him their essence, their wisdom, their goals. Thus, he stands now, a tapestry woven from the fabric of diverse souls, a mosaic of resonance, a form of boundless potential.

[[Aodh Tabris]] has found the ==red transmutation circle.== The end is near.  ^[*Apparently, this is VERY bad*]

Sometime in the last 6,000 years, the [[Day of Imbalance]] befell us, resulting in the overturning of Faerun and transmogrifying our existence into what it is today. 

It is well documented that the imbalance and rescindment of Faerun occurred in tandem, and it is of common belief that the Goddex, previously considered a chuya, protector of life and virtue, caused or had a massive hand in the event.

[[Aetheon]] (*God?*) was responsible for the regeneration of [[Aodh Tabris]] and provided him with his sublime powers. It was once of common belief that [[Aodh Tabris]] had become forever eternal from his dispense, but in actuality, Aodh reincarnated every 1 000 years. ==His brain is preserved in all its purity, unlike the rest of his body.== (*Then what happens to Solas Tabris?*)

The sands of time and gaze of Death some call it fate, or even destiny, but to me, this is war. Everything has a cost.
