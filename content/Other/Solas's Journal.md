##### The journal of [[Rêvgo Druci (Solas Tabris)]].
---

#### Dear Diary,

This is it. I’m finally doing it. The druids were very kind and gave me this journal to keep track of what I do everyday. I’m pretty new to this, but I bet I’ll get better.

I don’t want to write my whole life story, but I can still introduce myself.
Really quickly, my name is Rêvgo Druci, I’ve been raised by druids, and I am leaving them tomorrow. It was very hard for me to make this decision, but I felt, and still feel like I’m bothersome to them. My druidic powers are still bad despite my intensive training while the others are already learning harder spells and training to wild shape!

Life’s unfair I guess. Never found anyone of my species, that’s why I’m going to the nearest city, Neverwinter! It’s going to be my first time in society. From what I’ve heard, the cities destroy nature to expand, grow bigger and bigger. If I’m to be honest, I’m ~~scared~~ nervous about that. My journey here won’t be too eventful, so I’ll update this book when something of note happens.

#### Dear Diary,

A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENED. I was casually walking along the dirt path, gathering berries and other stuff to make food, and this dark elf, if it’s what she actually said, tried to kill me!
She failed, of course, but I don’t understand? Why would someone want to kill me? I’m writing this as she’s sharpening her weapon, but I’m confused. She seems to be less angry at me now, for whatever reasons, and I’m getting lonely, so I’ll ask if she wants to come with me.
Again, why? Why murder me? What have I done?

Update: After a bit of convincing, she said yes. We’re almost in the city, just a few hours of walking, I think.

#### Dear Diary,

I got hired for a mission along with Zeryth. We didn’t have much to do so we accepted. Our 3rd teammate is a half-elf bard called Norovar.
He’s okay. Not very reactive when we got into a fight.
We got attacked by two goblins, Zeryth literally melted one with her power. The goblin’s sword flew into the other one! I’m VERY, VERY glad she’s on our side.

I got hurt by a goblin and she rushed to me with a health potion once the fight was over, she literally forced me to drink it! A third goblin, which we didn’t see, jumped onto the tarp of our caravan. I was terrified when I saw that a very hurt and scarred white dragon was resting on top of the caravan since we left! It flew away, thankfully. We interrogated the goblin, I slapped it with my tail by accident (I had seen a very pretty bird and turned around.).

It told us who gave it orders, a bugbear in a nearby cave, we also got proof that Gundrin and Sildar, the person who hired us, got captured by it. We went there after taking a rest.

Goodnight!

#### Dear Diary,

Oh how the world is cruel. The day was long and I have a lot on my mind as I’m writing this. First and foremost, we woke up to the sound of a fight in the tavern. When going down from our room, we met a rather rude man. After a bit of speaking, he told us the location of some Redbrands, a group of bandits terrorizing Phandalin. We went to their small camp, inside the Sleeping Giant.
As soon as I entered, one of the Redbrand called us “puppies”, and also called me a lizard. I wouldn’t have minded the insults if he didn’t grab a small critter, a lizard, threw it on the ground and stomped on it several times.
I did my best to contain my anger and to tear his throat out immediately, Norovar gave pebbles to the drunk barman, and Zeryth “Eldritch Blasted” them.

We then made the one who stomped the lizard unconscious and killed his teammates. I dragged him to a nearby wrecked house, the stench of death was sickening, I think Norovar and Zeryth saw multiple innocent’s dead bodies.
I threw the Redbrand in a closed off room, his only way of escaping was to crawl towards me.

He begged for mercy, how dare he. I couldn’t control my anger, I had to kill him, right here, right now. But first, I wanted to ask him a question.
“Which one do you want to see? The puppy, or the lizard?” I asked.
He panicked, convincing himself that we’ll let him live. He chose the puppy.
I wildshaped into a dire wolf. His death, at the moment, had to be the most painful one I could give. I bit his arms, tearing them off of his body. Blood was everywhere, his, was disgusting.

Fortunately, to plead for his life, he gave us the location of their headquarters.
We infiltrated the HQ with their cloaks, to save space on my journal, let’s just say we killed most of them and their leader, but spared enough to convert them into a better group, one we decided to call “Whitemains”. We found a goblin called Droop, he’s rather friendly and can control himself. We also met a strange creature, Norovar had a strange reaction to it. Then I heard it speak into my mind, saying something like “I know what you did”. Now the current question I have is whether it’s telling it knows something I did in the past or what I did to that “poor” redbrand.

#### Dear diary,

Today, we went to the Cragmaw cave, where the bugbear was hiding. We killed two goblins and entered the cave. I freed 3 binded wolves, they were very nice! They told us some details about the cave and helped us kill the bugbear. Speaking of! I finally got to wildshape!  I transformed into a dire wolf, breathed fire on the wine the bugbear & his dog was sitting on. Zeryth blasted the dog’s soul away. The bugbear ran through a hole and got devoured by the wolves and I.
We cleared the cave, killed every goblin inside. Zeryth got injured, but it was okay. We found Sildar, but no traces of Gundrin. We all decided to go to Phandalin with me being the only horse for the caravan.

We arrived at Phandalin, got some neat stuff in a shop next to a shrine. Norovar showed his broken sword piece to the woman, who told us she needed the whole sword to identify it. I got some pink cloth to strap on my leg, that way, my teammates will know if I’m wildshaped.

We then went to a shop, got a map, two lodestones and Newt eyes for Zeryth. The shopkeeper was old and mean. He was very scared of me, for some reason.

We went to the woodworkers, Zeryth forced me to speak up. I don’t know how to buy things! I asked them to fix our carriage, thankfully, Norovar finished the rest of the conversation and paid for the repairs. We bought repairs for the caravan and went to the Inn.

We went to the Inn, I got some ale and I was very tired. Norovar bought rooms for all 3 of us.

Goodnight!

#### Dear Diary,

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!
Everything I wanted to do today IS RUINED.
The Nothic to speak to? GONE
I went to an abandoned blacksmith. There was this jewelry tool, I was charmed by it. When I picked it up, ancient druidic runes were present, I didn’t recognize them at first until it was too late. “Forbidden, Forbidden, Forbidden”. FUCK, IT MELTED INTO ME. IT’S IN MY BONES. I can feel the METAL in my bones. It hurts, thinking about it hurts, I broke a very important rule, I might become a druid outcast, losing all my powers, the adrenaline I get in Wildshape, GONE. I’m trying to sleep, but I can't. I can’t stop thinking about it.

#### Dear Diary,

Too much stuff happening. We met cultists for the green dragon nearby. They poisoned us, my strong metabolism made me resist the poison and paralysis. They tried to feed us to the dragon, I killed one of them before they used a spell that gave me so much pain I went unconscious.

I think Zeryth and Norovar killed the rest, they helped me right before the fight ended. We decided to meet with the dragon, his name is Venomfang. We struck a deal, give him gems, kill the druid living nearby and he’ll tell us information on Cragmaw castle’s location. 

In fact, we learnt more than we asked. My, and Zeryth’s cursed objects are made from a metal called “Nefra”. I have nefra tools in my body.
I can’t believe I’m calmly writing this, in an orderly manner, but if I want to look back at my life, I have to.

Apparently, my curse might be different because of my tail, that’s what the dragon said; oh yeah, apparently dragonborns don’t have tails?
We didn’t want to fight a dragon, we were weak from the poison despite our rest. Henceforth we took the decision to kill the druid.

We went to his house, I cast Hold Person on him and TRIED to wildshape. I couldn’t, despite my best efforts. Zeryth and Norovar finished him. When the druid died, the body forced me to approach it. His hand reached out to me, grabbed my shoulder and his… life force? was sucked into me. Now, I feel something growing on my back, I’m scared.

We left towards Phandalin, met a shopkeeper called Willy, he is a trickster. He’s selling overpriced items that don’t even work. I bought a rat for 5 gold pieces and it exploded as soon as I dropped it on the ground. My body forced itself to eat its heart, and I suddenly wildshaped into a rat. What monster am I becoming? Do I have to eat animal’s hearts to wildshape? My body has changed so much since I became an adventurer. I now have metal inside of my… what it feels like my bones, my wildshaping powers are gone, unless I ate the animal before.
Hey at least I can cut gems perfectly, what a nice fucking tradeoff…

#### Dear Diary,

We've done all the quests the mayor gave us, we should go back to the Inn to get our reward.
We met a wizard with red robes. According to Zeryth, they are evil, so we tricked him and killed him.
We also obliterated a banshee.

We also found the Nothic, and Droop! I asked some questions to the Nothic and I'm afraid I got more questions than answers.
Apparently I ate a druid whole? I don't remember that, apparently I was so hungry that I had to do it. I don't know if I should believe it.

We also got all the pieces to Zeryth’s sword! It's the representation of Greed, apparently, mine is Wrath while Norovar is Lust. Huh, I realized I haven't talked about Norovar’s curse. A gauntlet that allow him to project a slime copy of himself.

When I tried to use my ability, which is something similar to telekinesis, I fell asleep.

Fuck, forgot to mention as well, the banshee gave me a criptic answer to a question about my tail: She answered with “Perhaps you are something else inside another, not meant to happen but regardless, you are here now and nothing can change that.”

Oh, and lines of… whatever are growing on my back. What am I?

---

#### Dear Diary,

Today was an… “information-filled” day. Norovar and I started the morning by experimenting with our cursed powers. I can control up to 3 pebbles with my mind, isn't that great!

Then, we went to Cragmaw Castle. We killed some goblins, yadi yadi yada, you know the drill. We found an owlbear while fighting some hobgoblins. I managed to call it down and told it to be free. It had forgotten its egg, a good thing we didn't touch it, otherwise we'd have an angry owlbear on our ass.
Can't believe Eldrin wanted to make an omelet out of it, what kind of monster is he?

Oh, we saved Gundrin. He was being attacked by a furious hobgoblin and a drow. She had the same powers as Zeryth, and a similar name as well. Vyeryth or something like that.

Anyways, Gundrin is saved, I know why he sent us. He found a cave, the “wave echo cave”, that required dragon breath to open it, hence the white dragon and why I'm plan B. That's two questions answered.
As for Norovar, there is a spell forge hidden within it that could create a spell strong enough to cure his mother. Looks like this adventure is coming to an end…

Update:
I know what I am! A monster! Great! We brought Gundrin back to the city, right after Zeryth and Norovar blew up a whole orc and goblin army with a, what they call, a “nuke”. It was a complete bloodbath.

Gundrin was under mind control, thanks to the Nothic, the spell is gone. The drow who cursed him Is likely to know where we are.

Now for the funny part. I asked Greed about my family, and myself basically. 80 gold pieces, a bargain compared to the previous deal of 300gp. My #### Dear Diary, remember when I absorbed the druid? Of course you do, pages don't forget, unlike our brains. Anyways, I am cursed to become a dragon.
My clan was cursed by a dragon, a dragonborn destined to be a druid would become a husk and after a while, become a dragon whose goal is to destroy everything. Lucky me, my parents had twins. Unlucky everyone, my twin was stillborn and I absorbed them.
Meaning, I am a ticking time bomb. My tail is just a sign that I am becoming a dragon. The lines on my back? Wings, ready to deploy when I lose myself to the curse. What's really fun is that I need to eat druids for the curse to advance, but if I don't, well bad stuff would probably happen. Maybe I lose my mind and do it, maybe I die, who knows!

Greed estimated two months before I need to… eat one. Wait. If the starvation comes faster every time, what will I do? Greed told me there's a golden ratio to this transformation, a good middle point, but what if I still need more?

Good thing I'm doing a journal, maybe someone will need it to know how a dragon came to try and destroy the world. Zeryth mentioned me being a child of Tiamat, I should get books about that.

There's too many things happening at once. Basically all the questions I had were answered at the same time and I need to process everything. At least Greed calls me a dragonborn now… am I still a dragonborn if I'm actively becoming a dragon?

 Either way, I have to find a way to destroy or at least revert some of it.

#### Dear Diary,

We finally went to wave echo cave, our final destination to find a cure for Norovar’s mother. We found Venomfang’s corpse. All of his flesh was gone, no traces of it left, only bones were remaining. We desecrated his corpse to give his bones to Greed and keep his skull as decoration. He deserved it anyway, he led me towards continuing the curse.

The cave contains a mineshaft and we got ambushed by a slime. It fell on top of me, good thing Zeryth helped me out. We explored the rest of the caves until we found a room containing so many skeletons. I felt drawn by them, I recognized that feeling, the same when I saw the druid’s corpse in Thundertree. 3 souls of druids, all in one place, I did my best to resist but I couldn’t. With all three of them combined, I gained control of my tail, my wings grew, I grew 2 inches taller and my breath weapon feels stronger. Unfortunately, the druids were all “weak” and I know I’ll have to find more souls soon. 

While absorbing the last soul, I saw visions of the future, MY future if I were to fall to this curse. An enormous dragon towering even mountains, thousands of meters tall. We need to find a way to revert this curse, because even Greed didn’t know. That’s why he wants us to kill a dragon and give him the whole body, it’s only so they can access the beast’s mind and give me more information. We found a “Spectator”, a flying beast with a huge mouth and one eye. He was honestly very nice, bound by contract to the spell forge. Unfortunately, it was recently used to make gloves of strength.

We now know that the healing spell the Black Spider made requires a willing relative to activate it. Greed told us he was Zeryth’s cousin.

Update:
We took a little break in the cave and eventually went to the Black Spider’s room. After a bit of talking, we eventually fought over the healing spell. The fight was intense, Zeryth used her scroll of Fireball and practically melted his body, that is until one of the giant spiders behind took over his body. He became a drow, which I bit with Wrath, directly replacing a bit of his own Wra- Oh yeah, he had another part of Wrath inside of him. Anyway, Norovar killed the monster with a shatter spell, and I wish I was kidding, directly inside its ass. Then the remaining Wrath fused with the 3 other giant spiders turning him into a… I’ll call it a “Nefratic Dragon”, controlled by Wrath.

I used the part of Wrath I could control inside of him to force his maw shut after he breathed acid on us. Luckily, all of us dodged most of it and we didn’t get too hurt. An explosive bolt from Norovar exploded the dragon’s tail away, destabilizing it when it grabbed us and flew through the cave to smash everyone in a new room. That’s when I used a nearby druid’s body, a powerful one as well, that enhanced my breath weapon. The Nefratic Dragon was already exhausted and injured thanks to Greed. Eldrin used his arrows to make the dragon kneel, Norovar used Lust to throw three shatter spells on the dragon’s mouth, Zeryth teleported on top of it and used Greed’s artifact to “Eldritch Blast'' a piece of his throat away. I then climbed on top of him and breathed fire directly into his body, through the newly made hole.

From the druid, I should have what I think is about a year and a half of satiation. We went back in the room and found a bunch of loot. We found the healing scroll and its instructions. We also found a brass dragon egg! To think I went away from the circle just 50 days ago and did all of that is crazy. Seriously, I discovered I’m basically a time bomb for the end of the world, got cursed AGAIN by a sin and KILLED A DRAGON IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS?!? Well that’s not all that happened, but it’s the thing that matters to me the most for now. There’s still everything happening to Zeryth and Norovar, of course.

I’m glad we’re going to have a break. I really need it, especially since it’s one of the rare times I’ll have a lot of satiation of the curse. I really want to accompany Norovar to heal his mother, but I’d understand if he doesn’t want me to come. Oh yeah, Norovar got a letter with either his name with a title with “king of …” or the sender was a king. I couldn’t decipher it from that far and honestly, I shouldn’t really do that.

Welp… During that break, I’m planning on hunting more animals for their hearts, help the bronze egg hatch, train to control my tail, find out the new limits of my enhanced breath weapon and- Well, I was about to say therapy, but I don’t think anyone will take me seriously; you’ll have to do, my dear diary. I also remember people talking about Conyberry, an old dragonborn settlement, I should check there.

Here’s what I saw in that vision, in the cave:

---

#### Dear Diary,

What is real anymore?  So much happened in
2 or 3 days. Alright, I need to explain whatever 
happened to try and understand what the fuck
happened.

I went to investigate the new hostility of 
the beasts nearby. I saw a ruin with druidic for
“land of the cursed forest, the stump, all who enter
will experience hell.”. Confused, I ignored it and talked to the nearby wildlife. They all felt strange, scared of me for no reason. They didn’t want to mess with
“Aodh”. Might I say, Aodh, in old draconic, means to burn or to kindle. The animals seemed scared by it, fleeing me whenever they had the chance.

I found the snake I was looking for and followed it towards an empty tree stump. It must’ve been what the text warned about, because Wrath pulled me towards the hole and, well, I fell in. Now, here’s where the weird part happens.

I landed on the branches of a tree, immediately getting impaled by them. I felt my life fade away until, Poof! I landed safely without harm. Dolls were attached to the bark of the tree and when I looked away, one of them cut my head off and Poof! Back on the tree like nothing happened.
Whatever happened, it seemed like I couldn’t actually “die”, and I won’t explain all of my deaths because that’s embarrassing.

Anyways, there were ruins far away from where I landed. To the West was an altar with symbols I did not recognize. To the North was a beautiful garden decorating a house. Somehow, an older Norovar resided here. I couldn’t speak and I couldn’t hear, so we discussed using our blood. In the end, I needed a gem, and I asked him where it was. (I am heavily shortening what actually happened.). He then wrote “Anything for Aodh” and cut his chest open, where his heart would be. He died, and I took the gem. Did he confuse me with Aodh? Who is even Aodh!

To the South was a village, dead dragonborn druids everywhere. The sight was horrifying. I looked up and there I saw myself… or what I saw in my vision in Wave Echo Cave, but this time, I was a bystander. It was huge, it even destroyed a mountain in one single hit. I explored the village more and got into the town square, Zeryth’s body was lying there, holding a blue gem. When I walked out of town, I discovered a blue portal. I hid behind a rock and saw a huge knight crawling out. I don't know who they were, but their armor was terrifying, it was decorated with carvings of screaming heads on the lower part, as well as on the belt. I have no idea or guess on who they are.

To the East was a dragon’s hoard. Inside, a bronze dragon, which I am guessing is the one in the egg we found. It knew me, and I asked for the yellow gem.
I went back to the altar with all four gems and burned them all in their respective torches. Where I landed in an arena, fire and lava all around. A temple in the shape of a demon or devil was towering over me. At the mouth of it was myself, with a different color tone. When it hurt me, it hurt itself. When I hurt it, it hurt me. So I threw it into the mouth of the temple and followed it down.

Then I landed back into what I THOUGHT was the normal world. I started to go back home and an infested, full of worms and ants, white dragon killed me. This place was starting to turn me crazy. I, again, was sent back to the start. I redid my steps and this time a red portal opened. I went in, and landed inside a dining room with 12 seats near the table. 7 black figures were sat, and maybe it’s just a coincidence, but isn’t there 7 sins in total? After a while, a white figure appeared and it made me wish to go back home. I teleported to the stump again, this time it was all grown, stretching seemingly infinitely towards the sky.

Well, I THOUGHT it was all over, because I got to go back home and sleep, but you’ll NEVER guess what happened. I fell back into hell. I started to do everything all over when one of the dolls that killed me at the very beginning asked for Wrath. Well, I gave it to her and it took half of Wrath! It used to open a metallic looking portal, when I entered it, I only heard “LEAVE” repeating over and over, when I asked how, I felt my whole body burn until I appeared again. This time; outside, right next to the manor. I had kept the staff, the wildshapes I got, (By the way, I think I should be concerned about the delicious raw taste of the animal hearts) and that’s where I came home and started writing this. The other’s aren’t back and I’m so tired from all of this. But I’m scared that if I sleep, it’ll start all over. Maybe a nap won’t hurt?



A thing I know for sure: I have to remove Wrath from me. Despite the powers it might give me, it's too dangerous to keep.
First, I can feel it pushing me towards those druid souls, the force feels more physical, as if my bones were moving on their own. Second, the taste of hearts is a growing concern of mine, why are they so good? Thirdly, that asshole made me jump into HELL.
I know Greed said removing a sin is dangerous, but keeping him is going to be worse in the long run.

---

#### Dear Diary,

Today, we’ve got a lot of answers as well as more questions. We’ve all had disasters when we were alone, except Zeryth. It took some time for me to trust that I wasn’t in hell anymore. Norovar found out that the black spider is still alive, he got an arrow stuck to his eye, which I removed as well as his pinky toe cut. Eldrin also, somehow got Gluttony as a sin?

I’ve asked Greed how to survive turning into the sealed dragon. There are two ways: transfer my soul to another body and awaken the dragon or ask Greed to speak to Wrath. I’d prefer the latter if I had the choice.
We’ve also learned that the stump in which I fell is called the “Planetree” and that “hell” was another plane.

Norovar got info on Aodh, he saw his gravestone accompanied by a snake.
Speaking of Aodh, we know he’s a red dragonborn and that he’s been killing druids. In Neverwinter, we met a white dragonborn (I nailed that social interaction, I think), gave us a note and a book under our room’s door. The note said “Beware of Aodh” while the book had only one paragraph written on it, I shall copy it:

“Aodh, the true world ender, the bringer of Calamity. The garden of Resurgence is his birth and the end. The new gods will reign over as the old ones’ souls go into nothingness and obscurity. There are two souls within him.
The fourteen shall bring souls to the new gods as the 3 husks watch over.
The husks names are:
- Despair
- Hope
- Genesis

One thing I and Greed know for sure: my birth name is not Aodh.

Oh, Norovar healed his mother! He used his torn off eye to wake her up. When he implanted his new eye, he looked at us weirdly, like, staring at us.
I also fed on a druid that day. We’re planning on taking a short break since we have no real reason to adventure for now. I could look for Aodh, but with no other clue to where he is, it’s practically impossible.

Instead, I’ll be doing research on a few things, notably how to raise a brass dragon, get some supplies, help Neverwinter’s farms, and if there is a dragonborn district - I should ask Norovar… - I will probably try some of my people’s food. There’s also racism between scale colors, I’ll look into it.

---

#### Dear Diary,

Our party decided to take a big break from adventuring, especially now that we have saved Norovar’s mother.

It has been two months, so I’ll write or rewrite the information I got and log what I did.
I’ve got some ingredients for potions of healing, I’ll have to craft them. An alchemist gave them to me, and said “The intent is more important than anything else”. I wanted to thank him but I couldn’t find him anymore.
I tried to find wizards to identify the staff from the Planetree, they weren’t very useful, what a scam. When I was having a break, a sorceress used it to cast a spell which I recognized was unique to clerics, interesting.
I’ve helped some farmers with Plant Growth, I got around 300 gold pieces from them, neat!
I’ve researched brass dragons. One library had a book about them; but it had horrid handwriting and used old words I don’t recognize. Here’s what I understood from it:
Keep the egg very warm, intense heat wouldn’t even harm the shell and might even boost its hatching speed. It’s very important we don’t let the egg go cold.
When hatched, wyrmlings are pretty random, one thing they have in general are constant sleepiness and a big appetite for meat and… cabbage?
I had trouble reading this, here’s what I deciphered : “Discard wyrmling if…”.

I also went as leisure inside the dragonborn district:
The gang war between red and white dragonborns is an old conflict. There were many different dragonborn colors except white. They were all very welcoming.
In the gang war, white dragonborns were kidnapping and selling red dragonborns for their breath, useful for forges. Probably why there weren’t many white dragonborns.
I’ve tried some of my people’s foods! Most of them were tasty, my favorite was the chicken on a stick, the spices on them were great! A lamb stew had an intense taste, I didn’t ask what the ingredients were… The black talon however was not good, it was bitter and the texture was slimy.

Finally, for the pill, I went to a doctor to identify it. I think she thought I was asking for more because of how she talked to me. She said “Listen junkie, we don’t make those anymore, if you want more of that crap, go talk to some beggars.”. My guess is that the pill is some sort of drug that was legal before? It was probably something that was addictive and stimulant. Either way, I shouldn’t take it.

I also got the weirdest interaction ever, which I should’ve guessed since I have a tail and that I’m not from the town. Some people apparently recommended me to a “dragonborn fixer” in Neverwinter, whose name is Kreston. First, how rude, “Dragonborn fixer”, like I need to be fixed... Secondly, who walks up to someone and tells them that? I have no idea where he is. But I guess he will one day come to us and tell us stuff…

---

#### Dear Diary,

Do I have to write” dear diary” every time? It feels like life isn’t dear anymore. The party and I met back at the tavern in Neverwinter. During our two months break:

Zeryth met up with a criminal underlord, found that there were 4 criminal underlords, a silver dragonborn, an elven woman (Norovar talked to this one), a drunk human (this is the one Zeryth met) and a retired guard captain. They’re all fixers which apparently means illegal job givers and not repair people… That silver dragonborn is likely Kreston.

Norovar spent time with Lilith, the bartender, and tried to get info on Drangleic but failed. He talked about the Lust gauntlet, apparently a collector has one for the opposite arm. My guess is that Lust is a set of armor, we know of 2 gauntlets, the rest is unknown. He might get a job to steal the gauntlet.

Eldrin just trained as a soldier, did some bodyguarding and met and talked to some locals or merchants. He also might get new jobs for his work.

I gave the pamphlet about dragon eggs to Eldrin, who immediately read the old elvish I couldn’t decipher. I’ll rewrite the whole thing:
“Keep the egg very warm, intense heat wouldn’t even harm the shell and might even boost its hatching speed. It’s very important we don’t let the egg go cold.
When hatched, wyrmlings are pretty random, one thing they have in general are constant sleepiness and a big appetite for meat and… cabbage?
“Discard wyrmling if it bears the birthmark”. Next to it was a drawing of the birthmark, which is very similar to the mark Norovar can see under my eye.
“Feed mushrooms” along with it a drawing of a mushroom which seems like it would grow in the cold.
To tame, speak those words: “Grow thine beast, With the power of Calamity, thy will grow strong.””. More stuff about Calamity, we ought to learn more about that, since it’s linked to Aodh.

We took a quest to help a woman who was living in a place too dangerous to the recent dragon sightings. We went there and fought some manticores, they hurt, but we managed. During our fight, one of them vanished and turned into ashes. When we thought we were done, Patience appeared, battle-stressed, we reacted recklessly and attacked him. TURNS OUT PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE AND THEY FUCKING DISINTEGRATED ZERYTH?!? Zeryth was saved by someone who wished her back to life, a magical gate was put under my feet to gods know where (but that Greed guesses is one of the husks, Calamity, again!!) but something prevented it from happening, and then tentacles attacked us.
He then vanished.

Terrified; we went back inside. I bought spell materials at a hefty price from Greed to cast, with the wand I found, “Legend Lore”. Here’s what we learned:

“Lancelot, harbinger of patience, wields time's sway, halting, skipping, or stalling at whim. Through eons halted, wisdom amassed, tomes devoured in temporal hush. None dare challenge, for he holds knowledge vast, surpassing virtues and vices alike. His sorcery reigns supreme, a match for ancient gods. Master of the arcane, vanquisher of Greed's mightiest, even in the shadow of Lust's armor.”

So yep, here’s why I think Lust is an armor.
We went back to the tavern, all traumatized from what had happened. We got our quest reward, and I talked to the dragonborn to which I gave moonshine in the morning. He gave me some valuable info, I’ll have to give him more moonshine!
His name is Ipal, he’s from Conyberry, a now abandoned dragonborn camp. 17 years ago (my age), a lot of babies had to be abandoned due to the cultists of Calamity (AGAIN!). The name Aodh is familiar to him. From what I can guess, I was probably born there.

Oh, I can’t believe I forgot about Augustus. He’s a human artificer; has scars on his neck from an assassination attempt and a prosthetic arm. We hired him in exchange for an equal share of the loot we get (20% for everyone), as well as the possibility he might get inspiration for his personal goal. He’s the one who renovated the manor and built defenses for Phalandin, as well as upgrading the town in general.


##### **Dream diary time:**

I’ve had a nightmare, a horrible one. I was outside, next to the Tresandor manor. It was burning, bodies screaming in torment. It reminds me of Hell, when I was in that dragonborn village near the Sealed Dragon. A shadowy figure was in front of me, and it said: “Lament.”. Its words hit like a tidal wave, grief crashing over me, blood escaping through my eyes, pain.
I remember chains binding me to the ground, he repeated “Lament.”. Blood pooled in my throat, my whole body felt like it was burning, he repeated, again, again, again. Suddenly, after what felt like hours of torment, he raised his arm and blinded me with light. That’s when I woke up, I don’t want to think about it, but it felt important, going back to sleep now.

#### Dear Diary,

We went on a quest to find magic items, the only things of note are we fought the white dragon, it immediately left when we did a lot of damage to it. We fought mimics, I also died. Having a broken nerve is a horrible feeling that I never wish to experience again. I gave that pill to the person we saved.
He swallowed it and imploded, blood and organs thrown around everywhere, right next to me. That happened for the 3rd time since I started adventuring…

When we came back home, we got transported to Dranglaic by the virtues. Galahad, whose virtue is Kindness, was a nice person. Despite a bit of trouble with Augustus, we managed to have an okay dinner. We agreed to help them to kill the versions of Patience ( in 3 different time periods ) in exchange for information.

We had 10 questions in total, we’ve learned that Dranglaic is a huge city, we’ve got more info on Lust and where a piece of it is. We’ve got information on how to get Eldrin more power, we know where users of Gluttony would be as well as which bow is the strongest in the world, the “5th God Key”, unfortunately, it's a weapon for which you need to be chosen and are unseeable by any. Zeryth’s mysterious goal of revenge needs to be done by destroying the underdark, an easy task since it’s already weakened by a dragon. We also know how to save a person from a sin: complete the sin’s pieces, kill it in its domain and absorb its opposite virtue. Augustus asked the location of the philosopher stone, which Greed apparently has. A soul is composed of: mind, heart and emotion.

For my questions, Aodh is my brother, the one tortured inside my curse for 17 years, well 1 700 years, since apparently 1 year here is 100 inside Calamity. Oh, the sealed dragon IS Calamity. One of the virtues was also trapped inside, my guess is that it’s from either Aodh or a previous bearer of Calamity. To destroy Calamity, we need a starting place: the Garden of Resurgence, according to Aodh’s book. We need to destroy Aodh and absorb its half of the curse, since mine is malformed and not complete.
We’d need to fight Calamity in his own domain. Just a casual 6 kilometers monster, easy to kill right?

Oh yes, the pill again, we might’ve released one of Temperance’s children, a bad thing according to Galahad. They also gave us items or power as a gift. Augustus got what he calls “Science and Alchemy”, Zeryth got a book with a powerful spell on it, Norovar got a lute which appears to suck things inside it, Eldrin got a quiver with magical arrows and I’ve got a fruit.

The book of Aodh has had more information revealed:
“Aodh, with the power of liberation, released the shackles that bound Wrath within the confines of his cell. With a symphony of arcane, he conversed with Calamity, striking an accord that shook fate. He freed a child of Temperance, releasing a soul from the labyrinth of restraint into the expanse of possibility. 
Yet, amidst these acts, Aodh became an alchemist of souls, a vessel for the amalgamation of essences. He drank from the chalice of experience, becoming one with the hues of countless spirits, each imprinting upon him their essence, their wisdom, their goals. Thus, he stands now, a tapestry woven from the fabric of diverse souls, a mosaic of resonance, a form of boundless potential.”

Which got me wondering, I’ve released Wrath by forming the Planetree and the pill freed a child of Temperance. Is the book both about Aodh and I, our part of Calamity are not complete; maybe the book writes itself as we both do things to release Calamity?

#### Dear Diary,

We took the quest to alert the dwarves of the incoming scarred white dragon. We killed oozes and demons in the temple of the dwarven god of greed. When we got out, the white dragon ambushed us. He breathed ice onto all of us, Norovar went unconscious, Zeryth went unconscious. Augustus died. Thankfully, we defeated the beast and used a scroll of revivify on our human friend.

As we were butchering the dragon for its materials; it woke up with black tendrils ripping its body. As a reflex, I threw the spell Galahand gave me, it wasn’t a good idea since the dragon grew bigger and bigger as a skeleton. Reaching, I think, more than a hundred meters tall. Light came out of its skeletal mouth, it looked up and destroyed houses in Phalandin and blew a hole into the fucking moon. I swear I could see something moving inside it. Safe to say, we all ran away. We later discovered his name is conquest.

Greed told us about a sword made to kill this gigantic monster: the “Dragon Slayer” as well as its location. It was getting late so we decided to go to our closest objective which turned out to be Lust’s chestpiece.

We went where the torso for Lust’s armor was. After many puzzles and enigmas, we managed to get to the treasure room. Inside were orbs showing us the history of our sin. Lust’s story was about a black figure talking to 4 others, made a deal to kill a silver one and ate its corpse. Lust got armor from a craftsman and killed them once they finished. Then 7 white figures fought Lust.

Wrath was a disagreement with other black figures, he had a huge sword and was unhappy. He spoke to a dragon, killed a lot of dragonborns and Wrath broke the last orb as I was about to touch it. He’s either ashamed or is simply trying to hide something from me.

Norovar then got the Lust torso and we went back to the manor. That’s when the dragon egg hatched!  We’re naming him Caladrius, the merciless. He doesn’t have the birthmark and like the pamphlet said, eats a lot of cabbages.

I’ve used the Scrying spell on Conquest, I saw him starting to regenerate, flesh melding back into its skeleton. Ravens were everywhere and are probably linked to it, hence the ravens we saw all throughout our quest. I’m also the victim of Scrying, Lancelot is spying on me but I can see the orb he sees and hears me through. While we’ve made a deal with Kindness to kill Patience’s users, we might need to put that on hold to defeat Conquest, one of the dragons of the apocalypse.

#### Dear Diary,

We went to Dragon Barrow, it was a huge hill shaped like a dragon. We met a centaur who asked us to help kill some orcs. Before we did that, we went into a cave hidden under a rock. There, we found Aethel, The Dragon Slayer, a legendary sword who might be able to defeat Conquest. There were also two tombs, which I presume are the corpses of Halleck and Priscilla, based on the writing inside the sarcophagi. We then helped the centaur, accidentally triggering a ritual summoning a giant electric boar. We defend ourselves. After the fight, someone who looked eerily familiar to Norovar talked and insulted us. Eventually, Augustus lost his cool and burnt him (dear god…). Turns out he was a puppet controlled by someone. We eventually left and went back to Phandalin; completed the dwarf excavation quest and had to meet with that dragonborn fixer I got recommended to.

He was disguised by a polymorph spell, he tasked us to go to Conyberry and clean it up of monsters, bandits, all that stuff. When we went there, there was the graveyard, my village’s graveyard. “Aodh Tabris”, “Mari Tabris, wife of Gerish Tabris,...”. I also discovered my name: Solas Tabris, it means “Pride, Light and Bright” in draconic. My real name… I also went to my house. On the floor was a book, a journal containing, in all of its pages the word, “wrath” over and over…

Once we cleared the Conyberry, we went down the well, Norovar said there was the Black Spider’s HQ there. Inside was Vivec who was honestly a very nice guy. He was very hospitable, tried his best to give us information on Sins by trying to translate a book about the sins. We know that eventually we will be controlled by our Sins. Wrath seems to really want to prevent me from discovering his past, but he made deals with dragons. He tried to control me to slap the book away and destroy it but fortunately it didn’t happen. Vivec also has a “friend” wyrm, their name is Wyrmy and I wish they weren’t sleeping when we were there, could’ve given it a snack.

Back at the tavern, Kreston (the fixer), gave us the choice of two more jobs. An assassination at a masquerade in Neverwinter or another one in prison. The problems:
Zeryth is a dark elf, definitely doesn’t fit in nobility with her appearance. 
I’m a red dragonborn, a race enslaved by noble white dragons
Augustus has his VERY recognisable prosthetics.
Only two of us know noble manners (I am not one of them.)

We’re going to try to find how to avoid those problems, probably with make-up, history lessons on slavery, etc…

We still need to find the mushrooms for Caladrius, now we know from Vivec that they’re from Icespire Peak. While Conquest regenerates, we’re going to prepare for the fight, get stronger and hope for the best.

#### Dear Diary,

While Augustus and Norovar were gone finding a missing mage, Zeryth, Eldrin and I went back to the temple of Olidammara, the god of mischief, gambling and “all those who enjoy a good party”; we went there for Eldrin, he wanted to learn the history of Gluttony.

Summarized, it was a yellow-headed figure fighting and devouring a gigantic skeleton. He then joins 3 black beings discussing at a table. Either way, we found out that the temple gave items depending on who entered it first; we had done Zeryth, Norovar and now Eldrin. Therefore we did it again with me entering first. After a few stupid riddles, (seriously, how is that temple not already completely empty) we got to the orb room again. There was a sword, Greed identified it as a third of Excalibur. Zeryth stole it from my hands and merged it with Greed. They disappeared for a few minutes and came back, both charged. Zeryth greedily took both…

We then went to the tavern. I discussed with Ipal, it turns out my father, Gerish, was a silver dragonborn and was the chief of Conyberry. I wonder where he is now, there wasn’t a grave for him in Conyberry, maybe that journal with only “wrath” written on it is his. I hope he didn’t become crazy. Maybe I’ll get to meet him, it would be nice to my family, except Aodh.
Now that I think about it, I can’t even go back to the druid grove I lived in, Gerish is basically my only chance to meet my family again; fuck you, Wrath.

#### Dear Diary,

We got a letter from Kreston telling us to meet somewhere. When we got there, Kreston and Seventeen (the fixer based in the Chasm district) met us to talk about the masquerade. After a foresight spell, we got insight on how the place looked like, where some guards could be and our targets.

First, Isobel, exploits nature, has a personal bodyguard. The ideal plan is to set a meeting in the top garden or potentially in her bedroom. She is vegan so she has an easily identifiable meal, poison might also work, but some people might have the detect poison spell. She also has a cat with a unique coat.

Next, the dragonborn slave trade leader. He’ll be on the top floor and it seems like it's a job for me. There will be other enslavers so I’ll have to isolate him and find a way to make his death natural looking.

Finally, the mayor’s son. This one will be tricky. It’s likely he’ll be at dinner, what we know of him is that he might try to get laid. Unfortunately the only woman in our party is Zeryth and I doubt she wants to act like that.

Seventeen seems really shy, didn’t speak a word during the whole thing but a powerful caster nonetheless. She gave us access to the forbidden records library, which is where I could find how to get expensive incense for cleric spells.

After our meeting we went to the graveyard. I needed to get a druid’s soul before I go feral from Calamity. In the church, a contraption blocked a “skeleton” as Zeryth said. She freed it and it turns out that it’s Halleck, the sin-killer. GREAT! Zeryth, this is the second time you fuck us up by doing things you shouldn’t!

We also found a poison shop where we met with a thief. He was incredibly annoying, kept telling us his “poisons were too strong for us.” Well, at the time we thought he was the shopkeeper. Stuff happened and we met the real one, Calvin. He told us that if we find that dude again, that he’ll be grateful if we off him.

In the morning, I had contacted Galahad about the fruit of Shajara he gave me. He said it was to take only in emergencies, something about “releasing the beast but losing control of your body.” Something to eat only if you’re certain that death is right here. We’ve had a lovely conversation with him, the Planetree contains a creature to not release, (I’m watching you, Zeryth), a sun angel if I understood correctly. He told us to call him if we heard stuff about Abaddon.

I asked him what was up with the moon. It turns out that the moon is being used as a nest for void dragon eggs, this happens every couple thousand years, so it happened before and it will happen again, I’m glad it won’t make the moon explode or anything.

We’ve also spoken about Wrath and how eating hearts feels better and better each time. Galahad told me it was fine, that it wouldn’t hurt me, but can I really trust him? Oh, and in case I really need to get a druid soul, there is apparently an Archdruid in a crypt north of Neverwinter. 

After that, Galahad read my thoughts (I was forced to.), however he seemed to have learned about a twist that is going to happen soon, that somehow is in my mind. Only thing I can think of is that maybe my dad is at the masquerade but surely not, right? Also, he asked us about that mannequin we saw at that old ritual circle for the thunder boar, apparently, it’s a child of Temperance.

I don’t know what we’re going to do, but we should focus on one thing at a time. Right now, it’s the masquerade.

#### Dear Diary,

So many things happened today. First things first, we went to a tailor to get our suits, masks and overall disguises ready. The shopkeeper there had a huge mustache and although he was rude, he was getting the job done.

We then went to the forbidden library, found some books to read to get information on how to read Celestial, some sins history and other things like that. Unsurprisingly, Wrath’s books are all destroyed. In the middle of the room is a big globe representing Toril. Calvin told us it would, using specific keys, lead us to high researchers. He had the key to Laine’s research place, she’s a half dragon and also obsessed with them. She immediately knew I was holding Calamity and had seen another Calamity-bearer before me, maybe it was Aodh?
After a fight with a young red dragon, that Norovar killed by heroically saying: “Uuuuuuuuhhhh… fuck.” (because she felt bored) we got to ask her a few questions. And guess what? Zeryth touched shit and broke everything! AGAIN!

In the end, she took my dragonology book (which she wrote) and gave me a golden lizard to eat that would tell me when I’ve reached the “perfect point” of Calamity, I am currently at 2.8%
After some shopping, we met with Galahad, who teleported us to a tavern in Avernus. Apparently, he killed the Archdemon that allows the place to make the “Hellfire” drink. That gave him a lifetime supply of everything in there. He gave us a card to create a minor portal to get there. 

We also met Ader, a honestly extremely creepy man. He has corpses everywhere in his place, it was a horrible experience. He gave us another target, (I hope it won’t anger Kreston.) as well as items that would be of use to assassinate people.

The target is Alister, he betrayed Ader and our only instruction is that he needs to suffer as we kill him slowly.

Now, for the rest, out of order and in a list:
Aodh got the red transmutation circle (whatever that is); apparently, it’s very bad news to the point where Galahad asked me if killing my brother would hurt me.
Anti-magic fields were created by the Trinity of One (Patience?), they are/were focused on ridding this world of magic. Someone who tried to join was outcasted and created the Trinity of Many (makes no sense) The guards at the masquerade will be part of them and the anti-magic makers will be hidden in lights, floors, furniture, etc…; they have to recharge for 1 minutes after 1 hour of usage.
We have info on our dragonborn target! His name is Albert, he has an identifiable birthmark and is severely confident in his abilities. He was born from 2 sorcerers and if pushed might show off. If he dies, the slave trade dies with him.
Halleck was slain by Gluttony. He is the fallen angel of Death and in total has killed 13 sin users.
Priscilla is the dead angel of the Sun, considered passive and nice, she is that figure overseeing Galahad. Galahad’s wife died and he later got the virtue of kindness. Someone called Arthur is mentioned and a clan being forged in the Sun as well.
Lust’s armor was forged by a dwarf who is currently under Neverwinter. A nefra forge exists which we can use to gain extra power. She was from a tribe who ruled over a castle and were the first vampires. They ate every single person they could, reducing the overall population by 20%. She is now dead but can be revived, all those who can don’t bother because why should they?
Void dragons! In short, they hatch on the moon. When they do, the moon will shatter. They have 4 heads and the only opportunities for us to slay it are killing the eggs or killing it in its infancy. Galahad killed one and emerged with new powers.
Wildshaping in Avernus is bad. The plane powers up the sin and I wildshaped into a monstrosity.
Wrath wielded Excalibur, it can kill Celestials and Dragons easily. Killing angels also gives you power.

Finally, some stuff Galahad said about some questions I asked:
He doesn’t know about the red gem, only that it seems to be from Avernus, weird considering one was about earth, another was water and the last one electricity.
Calamity has children of Temperance and Aodh is freeing them.
There are a “couple million souls” in Calamity. The curse started between 10,000 to 20,000 years ago.
Wrath being released is very bad for me.
Aodh gets the experience of souls he absorbs, therefore he must be VERY powerful.
Galahad doesn’t want to kill Aodh because it would continue the cycle.

Unfortunately I had to write those in a list, today was very tiring and summarizing it was necessary. We’ll keep low, I’ll write after the Masquerade.

#### Dear Diary,

Okay, we've done the masquerade. It was exhausting, very stressful but our targets, except maybe one or two, deserved it.

What I'm writing is incriminating, I know that, but History must be written.

While I'm not going to write all that happened, what I know is that we used Greed in the form of pearls to make Alister and Albert explode from the inside. For Isobel, she wanted the fixers gone so they used us to remove their problems.
The mayor's son, Sebastian, was abusing his soon-to-be-wife, not physically I hope.

The parts that struck me as most important were that person staring at Norovar after leaving Isobel's garden and the presence of Aodh. He was here, chained on a chair, the flesh gone exposing his ribcage. I had to cut his leg to keep my cover, it was horrible...

Until the anti-magic fields get turned off, he will be stuck here. When he gets out, I know he will try to kill us, or only me.

As for our magic items, Norovar and Eldrin used theirs. Zeryth, Augustus and I haven't used them or still have ours.

I told my druid grove about me and Aodh, and I wrote on the book of Aodh, they just wrote "Compromised."
