##### A red dragonborn druid cursed with [[Calamity]] and [[Wrath]]. He is part of [[The Misfits]].
***

### Backstory:

Rêvgo Druci was born in [[Conyberry]], a small dragonborn village near Neverwinter’s forests. Born alongside a stillborn twin, [[Aodh Tabris]], the dragonborn, a bearer of an ancient draconic curse, [[Calamity]], absorbed his brother’s soul.

With the village terrified by what had happened, Rêvgo was cast aside, abandoned in the nearby forest. Luckily, a druid village had found him and raised him; he learnt the ways of nature and how to use magic with it.

Despite his best efforts, the dragonborn had trouble at first wielding nature’s sorcery; he was late compared to his friends and classmates. After 17 years of living with the druids, he had decided to leave to explore the world and find his original family; his mentor and friends gave him a parting gift: a journal to write his adventures in.

A few weeks after he left, he met the exiled dark elf : Lady Zeryth, a drow which would go alongside him on his way to Neverwinter.
