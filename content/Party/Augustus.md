**Note:**
His work of art seems to be related to souls.
### Backstory:
He is an artist from [[Icewind Dale]] whose art gave him a lot of money; he quickly became a socialite. His ability to rake in wealth attracted a lot of envy from nobles. He was then assassinated and made a pact with a demon to stay alive. His goal is to create the "perfect work of art" that affects everyone, even the gods.
